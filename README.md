# notion-api

### This is a node js express backend that connects notion database to webflow frontend.

I used the notion sdk to connect my express node.js backend to a notion database api. The Api pulls from the notion calender, for every event put on the calender, the api will render the event on my webflow site as well. 

This is an easy way to turn the Notion note taking app into a CMS (content management system).
